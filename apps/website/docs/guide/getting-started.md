<hr/>

## ðŸ”¥ Features

Filledout has the following features:

- **Easy to Configure**: One of the goals of Filledout is to provide out-of-the-box core functionality as well as validation resolvers for popular solutions like Yup, Zod.
- **Framework-agnostic**: You can use the library without any framework. Also **Filledout** provides a range of packages to accommodate your specific needs if you want to connect your form model to UI with bindings for certain UI framework (or library).
- **Typesafe**: For frameworks bindings like React, we used JavaScript Proxy for form field usage instead of string-path manipulations, like it's done in popular form libraries, so thus providing native typings.
- **Fully dynamic**: No need for the annoying creation of separate units for each form field! Under the hood the library uses single source store for form values and provide a bunch of units for each form field, so you can easily prepare data/validation schema on demand.
- And so much more ...
