You probably want to connect your form model to UI so that's why there are packages with a bindings for certain UI framework (or library).
You can find a list of all supported packages in [API reference](/api/create-lib) section. All those bindings are optional and if you want to make your own - it's up to you. There are no rocket science and you can check source code of any of them.
