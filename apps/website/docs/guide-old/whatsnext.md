# What's next?

Currently @filledout is under development so be cautious no drastic api changes are planned tho.
You can propose your features on the [github](https://github.com/filledout/filledout).

Current plans are:
- documentation improvement (now it's really basic and you will probably need to go trough api docs or trough looking types in actual code)
- focus/blur subscriptions so you can focus/blur UI components using form events
- unit testing 
- zod validator
- automation (docs deploy/versioning/publishing/changelogs)
